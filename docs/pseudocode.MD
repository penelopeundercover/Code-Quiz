# Step 1
1. Which parts of my page are static, and which are dynamic?
    -Static(to be written into HTML): the timer, View High Scores button(link to high scores), Start button, Go Back button, Check Answer button
    -Dynamic(to be written in JavaScript): rendering question text, rendering each individual answer to that question
#Step 2 
1.Grab the Start Button Element on page using JavaScript
(This is already in the HTML).
2. When I click on the Start Button (event listener with a type of "click"), run the code to start the quiz.
3. Set the max time on the timer. Timer starts when the Start Button is clicked.
4. In HTML, there should be a container to append the questions and answers to.
5. Dynamically render the question to the screen.
6. Dynamically render the answers to the screen.
    -The answers should be buttons.
    -Remember, the default when you click on a button is that the page refreshes. So add an (event.preventDefault()).
7. Now that I have questions and answers on the screen, I need to check the user's answers.
    -Obviously it wouldn't be very efficient to put an event listener on every single question and answer.
    -Where to put the event listener for clicking on an answer: Event Delegation. 
        -Add the event listener to the parent (the HTML container that I'm appending the questions and answers to).
        -Then, element.match("button"). Figure out what text or attributes are on that button to compare to see if we're right nor not. (getAttribute/setAttribute).
        -If correct, show next question.
        -If incorrect, decrease time.
        -If time hits 0, end the game.
        -If there are no more questions, end the game.

#Originial Prompt
        ```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```
